course_description: "Statistical Inference is a fundamental and a very
important subject in the field of mathematics and
statistics , so essential that it significantly informs and
enhances disciplines such as Machine Learning. The
course provides students with the necessary tools and
techniques for analyzing collected data and utilizing
statistics in real and practical decision-making. This
course enables students to to evaluate hypotheses
and conduct hypothesis testing. It emphasizes
generating valid estimates, understanding significance,
effect sizes, and the power of tests to derive insightful
conclusions from data, enhancing data-driven
inference. Addditionally, it also touches upon concepts
of experimental design and Bayesian Inference. The
course is designed to reduce the stress of grades,
paving the way for a deep exploration of statistical
inference. It encourages students to delve into its
diverse aspects with the passion and curiosity of a data
scientist, applicable in in various components of social
sciences, natural sciences, finance, engineeing and
many many other fields."
